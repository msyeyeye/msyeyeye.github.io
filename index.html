<h1>Privacy</h1>

My app will be for <em>personal</em> use -- you shouldn't be using it. It won't collect any data except for the token it needs to access your Instagram account. It may read comments if you explicitely request it to do so; this is to allow it to process them and fulfil its purpose.
